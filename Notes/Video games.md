Why are you tryting to avoid video games ?
first and foremost, it's a waste of time, and it's so much fun. Simple. 

It also acts as a trigger point for my porn addiction, 
I've developed another nasty habit of going into nexusmods where I download nsfw mods. to brood over what could happen, a clear channel for porn.


I think i just grew out of video games, I dont enjoy it anymore, it's more like i'm forcing it upon myself because i have got plenty of free time...
So i force myself to open my PC only for video games
like some sort of a drug to keep myself hypnotized a little bit. completely useless

It's as simple as. No video games this winter. Completely doable. 


doable but should i do it tho ? 

I'm allowed video games, 2 hrs every friday. that's it
