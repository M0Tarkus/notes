- in logic `!=` is similar to the `<>` operator which both mean (not equal to)
- Inner joins return matches only (no Null). If no matches, they are excluded form the results. It's good for identifying data intersections
-  outer joins returns everything with the Null statement of there are no matches found
- Left Join keeps the rows of table A regardless of matches found in table B
- Right join keeps rows from table B regardless of matches found in A
- Full join, makes sure that both rows in A and B are kept regardless of having matche

Outer Joins are full of Nulls for these reasons

Round() function is used to round numbers
