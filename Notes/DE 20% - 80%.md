### **1. SQL and Databases** (20% effort, 80% impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: SQL is foundational to working with data. Understanding databases is key for querying and manipulating data effectively.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - SQL basics: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`
    - Subqueries, Window functions, and Aggregate functions.
    - Understanding of relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    - Basic Database Design: normalization, indexing, and constraints.
- **Impact**: SQL skills will help you manage and query the majority of data stored in relational databases.
- **Timeframe**: 2-4 weeks.

### **2. Data Pipelines & ETL Concepts** (20% effort, 80% impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: Data engineering is all about creating pipelines that can **Extract**, **Transform**, and **Load (ETL)** data efficiently.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - ETL workflow basics: Extracting data, transforming it (cleaning, aggregating, etc.), and loading it into a target database.
    - Data wrangling and cleaning techniques.
    - Tools: Familiarize yourself with tools like **Apache Airflow** for workflow orchestration and **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming.
- **Impact**: Mastering these concepts will enable you to build pipelines that handle large datasets effectively.
- **Timeframe**: 3-5 weeks.

### **3. Python Programming for Data Engineering** (20% effort, 80% impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: Python is widely used in data engineering for writing scripts, automation, and working with libraries like Pandas and PySpark.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - Python basics: Loops, functions, file handling, and libraries.
    - Pandas for data manipulation (cleaning, aggregating, etc.).
    - Using Python to interface with databases (using libraries like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `SQLAlchemy`).
    - Working with APIs to collect data.
- **Impact**: Python is versatile and widely used for everything from automating tasks to building complex data workflows.
- **Timeframe**: 3-4 weeks.

### **4. Cloud Platforms and Storage Solutions** (20% effort, 80% impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure are essential for deploying and managing scalable data engineering solutions.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - Introduction to **cloud storage** (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    - Setting up databases in the cloud (e.g., AWS RDS, BigQuery).
    - Using **cloud computing resources** for big data (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).
- **Impact**: Understanding cloud platforms is critical for managing and deploying data pipelines in production environments.
- **Timeframe**: 2-3 weeks.

### **5. Data Warehousing** (20% effort, 80% impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: A data warehouse is a central repository where data from various sources is stored for analysis. Understanding how to design and work with data warehouses is a key part of data engineering.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - Concepts of **Data Warehousing** (OLAP, star schema, snowflake schema).
    - Tools like **Google BigQuery**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Snowflake** for data warehousing.
    - Basic data modeling principles (how to structure data for analytical queries).
- **Impact**: You'll be able to organize and structure data efficiently for large-scale analytical queries.
- **Timeframe**: 2-3 weeks.

### **6. Big Data Technologies** (Optional but beneficial for long-term impact)

- **Why it’s crucial**: While not necessary for every data engineering role, understanding big data technologies will set you apart for complex projects.
- **Key Concepts to Learn**:
    - **Apache Hadoop** and **Spark** basics for processing large datasets.
    - Data storage using **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System) or cloud equivalents.
    - Using **PySpark** for big data processing in Python.
- **Impact**: This is valuable for companies working with extremely large datasets (terabytes or more), but may not be needed for smaller-scale projects.
- **Timeframe**: 3-4 weeks (optional).
