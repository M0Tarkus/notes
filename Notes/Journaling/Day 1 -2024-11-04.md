## Brief and reasoning for this (Optional)

Consistency is king, My main goal is to be consistent with these diaries. There's too much to say here, Let's start with independence & Freedom.

My whole life, I have never tried reflecting thoughtfully in diaries.This is weird because even allah says in the quran that each one of us has angels writing down what we do, think, and say. It's rather for us to type down what we want to do and think so we could keep track of it and know exactly where we're heading in life. This is the start of this project.

Again *Consistency is KING *

Independence & Freedom are intertwined with self image, I can't speak about any of them without defining who am I.
