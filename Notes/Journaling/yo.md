take a deep breath, slow and steady wins the race
dont overwhelm yourself 
you will make it 
just take it easy 

its a priorities game
prioritize certain things over other

prioritize coding python everyday 
prioritize coding sql everyday
prioritize reading quran everyday

each task shouldnt take more that 2 hrs

that's 6 hrs of work 
maybe 3 for python 2 for sql
and 1 quran
take it easy 

# never study without measuring time
take notes, 
get the best out of obsidian 
adapt and learn 

measure study time
make blocks and stick to it and note it down after each day

breath in 
رزقي لن يأخذه غيري

just stick to a plan for 6 months
you need to be good at sql and python, everyday for 6 months. completely doable
