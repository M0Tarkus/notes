but let's recap real quick 
since like 3 or 4 days i haven't relapsed to porn, that's very good alhamdullah. A blessing from allah and a commitment to me to what i said before about porn
it's really rubbish, wast of time, waste of energy, and most importantly gets you away from allah. I dont want that. Allah and islam are my cores. Every day alhamdullah i'm more certain and in love with my deen. it's the best blessing I was ever got, I can not waste it with porn.

**فلنحيينه حياة طيبة**
هذا وعد الله عز وجل. تباركت ربنا وتعاليت سبحانك اللهم ربنا وبحمدك

Allah has blessed me with more than i could ever dream of
Most importantly he granted me a visit to his masjid al bayt al haram
This is the biggest blessing in 20 days, I will be there inshallah, he also  granted me the blessing of seeing my freind salem over there. يدبر الامر من السماء 
سبحانك اللهم ربنا وبحمدك 

احمدك ربي واشكرك علي علي ما انعمت علي. اللهم ثبتني علي طريقك وعلي هداك

I also deleted video games too <3 <3 <3 
I just realized. I really dont need it. Also it's haram, i was just faking it myself. making it halal for my desires. i dont need it and i was somehoo convincing myself that it was okay. Even tho it's not.

 For some reason I haven't done a system for myself yet. i will have it done today
