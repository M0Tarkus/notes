I was thinking of something very deep here before i slept yesterday being defeated to my shitty habits. but, when you think about it. It's really just some bad habits. Accumulations of a lot of shitty habits. They say that writing about your traumas and whatever is bothering you, helps you out to fix them and have peace with them. I'll give it a try..

Let's start with... nothing. I know my problems. I know them full well in fact that i never try to escape them. I love these shitty desires. these circles of guilt and misery. I dont like the guilt and misery but i got used to cheap thrills. Cheapest ones in fact. You like porn, here's an endless supply, here's a rat brain that will seek every nook and cranny on the internet to find them. You like food. Order fast food like there's no tomorrow, Indulge in everything. Amuse yourself to death. Eat, masturbate. Get Naked. Use VR to have sex. like a fucking loser. Kiss the Fucking Air. Mimic an actual human being. kiss keely rose, kiss another fake air slut. Virtual and fake. Watch a fucking stud smashing a very hot lady with the most average body there is. be an animal. that's what you want right?!.... and then feel some guilt and go eat like a pig and go ask Allah forgiveness like nothing happened. Like you haven't made something that upsets him.... fake it..fake it with him and yourself. fake it with everybody. but eventually that's what you're goin to do. why because you're hard wired, you have no salvation, you have done this so much that its become second nature. you escape the realities of being 27 with not sex and an ugly body with 40% Bofy fat. when is this going to end.....

My life with porn is so old. it feels it's been there with me for my whole life, it's limited my potential in every aspect. Most people don't know, but they are slowly finding out. That i'm a slave to the cheapest thrill there is. Allah promised hellfire to those who do this sort of stuff but look at me, it's like i fake it and i keep thinking he will forgive me if i keep repenting after i'm doing it, it's like i could never die in the act. 

You know what

Despite all of this shit, I dont believe in the erosion of freedom and freewill shit. It's just simple. My brain is wired with a very deep shitty habit that gives an immense reward. It's been like this from day one. you feel bored you go there and get rewarded with endless supply of females satisfying your deepest desire. Point and click to get an instant reward.

the main issue with this, is that it created a very automated brain, It's just the first thing I think of when i'm bored. it's corrupted my heart. I have indulged so much that it's starting to hurt me. not just starting 

# IT'S KILLING ME 

here's why, you do the deed, you lost energy meaning the next 24 hours wont be yours. you're recovering, you have lost your morale, you've forbade yourself the baraka of allah. you have put a lot of obstacles in the way.... Why coze you really didn't know where to go. 
why can't you automate the correct stuff. Like sleep for example. Work, even personal hygiene. It all comes to system. you just can't handle systems because you never tried to stick to one yourself. 

I've formed parasocial relationships with the shittiest people in the world I have Memorized their names I know them and they don't know me, They dont care. But allah will hold us accountable for our deeds. 

I've engaged with them in the ultimate sin. The guilt is really there but it's not. It's like the guilt is here but i've done it so much that i hasatisifyingve become used to it. My heart is so corrupted. I'm like this guy who killed 99 men. Killing more men, Watching more sex won't do me any good.

Loss of energy, Loss of dignity, Loss of Willpower, Thinking you're not in control. I never want to feel like that. Control. I'm totally in control. That's why i'm choosing to pray 5 times a day. That's why i'm choosing to watch reels and da'wa stuff. It's because i have a strong conviction of allah and his world and his deen. 

So what the hell is wrong with me. Why are you letting this small shitty thing control you like that. Why are you being a week bitch. Why are you writing papers and words and using pen into that same fucking topic. You're in control. Allah Knows you're in control, you know you're in control and you choose to do it. 

# Erosion

It's really simple, I've eroded my will and i've eroded my brain. That sin and act has become the easiest thing for me. وتحسبونه هينا وهوا عند الله عظيم. No promises no nothing. I shall not put myself in previous systems where it's become easy for me. I will make myself busy with everything except for this thing. 

Just remember this, your next time. Will make it stronger, and you weaker... The next time will make it stronger and you weaker. the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker the next time will make it stronger and you weaker. **Every time it becomes stronger and you weaker***

you could be a fucking **Boulder** but doing it enough time will obliterate you into dust.
Message is clear. you lose yourself to it and it's killing you. ENOUGH
### There's more to life than brooding over this filth

You know what you want to do
you keep yourself busy with fixing yourself
Everyday. You wake up you fix yourself a little bit
you make a system for fixing
What's the system for fixing
it has to be robust
minimal holes
bullet proof
it has to withstand everything

# *You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.*


My system is fragile that's the problem It's so cluttered with 3 competing bad habits

Porn 
Video games
Social Media
Youtube

These are the most destructive habits, The more you do it the more they get stronger and you become weaker. but you can defeat them all. It's imperative that you dont fight all of them at once. You only allowed one in each system. no system has the 3 of them

If you're doing two. That's high alert. meaning, either gaming or social media. if you do both, porn will be the third. never do 2 or 3 always stick to 1. only 1 and it's only 1 hr a week indulgance. you indulge in it Guilt Free. Fore one hour. 

1 Hour of gaming. Or 1 hour of social media. Till you defeat porn. 
also you have to write everyday for 10 minutes about why porn is bad for you 
this is a daily homework Starting today. You write that in your journal

I can see how could this system work. I just need to be obsessed with it a little it. 1 hr of gaming is enough. fuck social media. if you going to use social media you don't game that day. and you stay away from porn. It's the biggest thing that's killing you... steer away
 
## Why I didn't stick to my eat only monday and thursday?

I let myself go, i wasn't deligent enough to do so. For example, today is wednesday and i can't wait for Maghreb to go back to eating. It's crazy how my desires are against my actions. I'm Severely troubled when it comes to my desires. the soreness amplifies that issue too, I think i've developed this habit where i always feel hungry when my body is sore. I need to program that into a different thing. 

Soreness is a reminder to stick to the Mon - Thu. Eating days only. 

just 1 month stick to 1 month of doing so... and adjust after that month. 
Your Iftar is 100 grams of protein. don/t over complicate things

***Winter is coming, and you need to be ready.***
