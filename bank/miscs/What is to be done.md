-  Starting rolling 72s on the 12th of march 2025 till the end of Ramadan
let's make this straight, the only thing that's not allowed to be broken is the 72s, No matter what. This is as obligatory as Ramadan itself. This is core to my being. NOT TO EVER BREAK THE 72s. Eat to your hearts content when you break the fast, but never, and i mean never break the fast when you start it. Again, its already begun. 

This will not be taken lightly. I will repeat this till the end of my days. this shall not be taken lightly. Fast and Feast.
